## Problem & Opportunity

- Text prediction powers modern communication tools.
- From messaging apps to search engines, smart autocomplete makes writing faster and easier.
- Our goal: develop a lightweight predictive text model using R and deploy it with a user-friendly Shiny interface.

---

## Algorithm Overview

- Model Type: Bigram-based word prediction
- Trained on: Cleaned corpus from Twitter/news text
- Preprocessing:
  - Tokenization
  - Lowercasing and cleaning
- Prediction:
  - Input phrase is matched to the final word.
  - Highest probability bigram (prefix â†’ next word) returned.
- Future upgrades: Trigram, LSTM, or Transformer-based NLP

---

## App Demo & Instructions

- Hosted at: https://polarbear244.shinyapps.io/project-1
- How it works:
  1. Enter a phrase into the text box.
  2. Click Predict.
  3. App outputs the most likely next word.
- Use cases:
  - Writing assistance
  - Language learning
  - Tweet composition aid

## Business Value

- Efficient typing improves productivity.
- Customizable for any domain (medical, legal, social media).
- Scalable using more advanced models and deployment methods.
- Future potential: plug-in autocomplete for CMS platforms, mobile keyboards.
